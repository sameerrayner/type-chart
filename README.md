# Pokemon Type Chart
Source Data: <a href = "https://github.com/veekun/pokedex">Veekun's Pokedex Repository</a>

Each Pokemon uses moves, which are of a specific type (barring exceptions). Each Pokemon also has a type or two. Each type of move has a specific interaction with the type of the Pokemon it is aimed at, with certain type moves being more effective (e.g. Water deals twice the amount of damage to Fire), less effective (e.g. Ice deals half the amount of damage to Water) or not effective at all (e.g. Normal does not damage Ghost). These type interactions can be visualized on what is called a 'Type Chart' or 'Type Effectiveness Chart'. 

For this project, I exported csv files containing information about types and effectiveness from Veekun's Pokedex Repository. I read and cleaned these files using pandas and used matplotlib to create this type chart. To see the result of this visualization, visit <a href = "website-name-placeholder"> my portfolio</a>.
